# ChÃ o báº¡n (Hello) ðŸ‘‹
A little bit about me, my name is Thien or Tee. I'm currently a fourth-year Computer Science student at UCI with a deep interest in the fascinating fields of data analysis and machine learning. I truly believe in their potential to solve real-world problems through the transformative power of data and machine learning.

## PROJECTS
**CIFAR Experimentation**                                                                                            
- Conducted comprehensive analysis on the CIFAR-10 dataset, utilizing four distinct classification techniques: KNN classification, logistic classification, Neural Network classification, and Convolutional Neural Network classification.
- Developed and optimized models using prominent Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.
- Employed matplotlib to explore and visually present the data, as well as to depict the obtained results.
- Successfully achieved an accuracy of 73.6% on the test data by fine-tuning our CNN model.  

**MineSweeper**                                                                                                               
- Developed an AI Agent in C++ capable of playing and solving the classic Minesweeper game.
- Achieved a success rate of 84.8% out of a total of 1000 sample trials on a 16x16 grid board, and 33.0% out of a total of 1000 sample trials on a 16x30 grid board.
- Utilized RREF reduction to calculate the probability of potential moves for the agent when no obvious moves were available.  

**Web Scraping GUI Application**                                                                                
- Developed a desktop GUI application using Python, Tkinter, and Beautiful Soup to scrape stock information from finance.yahoo.com, providing efficient tracking of my stock portfolio status.
- Enhanced the application by implementing SQLite and Cryptography Fernet to establish an authentication system, ensuring data privacy. All data was securely saved and encrypted in a local database.
